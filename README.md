Skrop is a media service based on [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper) and the [vips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) library.

## Usage

In order to be able to use Skrop, you have to be familiar with how
[Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper) works.

### Install dependencies:
```
./packaging/build.sh
go get github.com/tools/godep
go get ./cmd/skrop/
```
### Run Skrop
```
go run cmd/skrop/main.go -routes-file eskip/sample.eskip -verbose
```
### Test

```
make all
```

To test if everything is configured correctly you should open in your browser
```
http://localhost:9090/images/big-ben.jpg
```
and the resized version
```
http://localhost:9090/images/S/big-ben.jpg
```

Here is how a route from the `sample.eskip` file would look like:
 
```
small: Path("/images/S/:image")
  -> modPath("^/images/S", "/images")
  -> longerEdgeResize(800)
  -> "http://localhost:9090";
```

What it means, is that when somebody does a `GET` to `http://skrop.url/images/S/myimage.jpg`,
Skrop will call `http://localhost:9090/images/myimage.jpg` to retrieve
the image from there, resize it, so that its longer edge is 800px and return 
the resized image back in the response.


## Filters

Skrop provides a set of filters, which you can use within the routes:

* **longerEdgeResize(size)** — resizes the image to have the longer edge as specified, while at the same time preserving the aspect ratio 
* **crop(width, height, type)** — crops the image to have the specified width and height the type can be "north", "south", "east" and "west"
* **cropByHeight(height, type)** — crops the image to have the specified height
* **cropByWidth(width, type)** — crops the image to have the specified width
* **resize(width, height)** — resizes an image without preserving its aspect ratio
* **addBackground(R, G, B)** — adds the background to a PNG image with transparency
* **convertImageType(type)** — converts between different formats (for the list of supported types see [here](https://github.com/h2non/bimg/blob/master/type.go)
* **sharpen(radius, X1, Y2, Y3, M1, M2)** — sharpens the image (for info about the meaning of the parameters and the suggested values see [here](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/supported/current/doc/html/libvips/libvips-convolution.html#vips-sharpen))
```

## Packaging

In order to package skrop for production, you're going to need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com).
To build a Docker image, just run the build script (the arguments are optional):


```
make docker version=1.0.0 routes_file=eskip/sample.eskip docker_tag=zalando-incubator/skrop
```

Now you can start Skrop in a Docker container:

```
make docker-run
```
